## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Project Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/based-rose/stack.git

# Navigate to the project
cd stack

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Create a Cloudflare Account: Sign up at cloudflare.com if you don't already have an account.
# No need to install Wrangler globally: Wrangler is included as a project dependency.

# Authenticate Wrangler: Connect Wrangler to your Cloudflare account.
bun wrangler:login

# Set up the database (very important step)
# This prepares the whole env for you by injecting the database name in important files
bun setup-db
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Run the environment setup script:
```bash
bun setup-env
```

This script will:
1. Copy all example environment files to their actual environment files if they don't exist yet
2. Generate a random secret for `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` and update it in all environment files

After running the script, you may want to update other environment variables:
- Set up a [Resend](https://resend.com) account for email services and add your API key *(optional: only for sending OTP for auth)*
- Update domain-related variables if you're using a custom domain

### 3. Running in Development Mode

```bash
# Start both API and web servers concurrently
bun dev

# Or start them individually
bun dev:api  # Starts the API server on http://localhost:8787
bun dev:web  # Starts the Next.js server on http://localhost:3000
```

The development server will:
- Start the API server using Wrangler on http://localhost:8787
- Start the Next.js web server on http://localhost:3000
- Connect to a local D1 database for development

### 4. Database Management

After running the development server, you can use `bun fix-db` to synchronize your database.
> This is a current workaround as we couldn't manage to share the same locally simulated D1 MiniFlare database in wrangler.

```bash
# Fix database synchronization issues after running the dev server
bun fix-db

# Generate migrations after schema changes
bun generate

# Apply migrations to local development database
bun migrate

# Apply migrations to production database
bun migrate:prod
```

### 5. Deployment Process

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Security Disclaimer**  
> Never commit secrets or API keys to git. While the current setup uses wrangler.jsonc for configuration (which may contain secrets), you should **never push wrangler.jsonc with secrets to production**. A better approach using Wrangler CLI for secret management is being explored. In the meantime, consider leaving wrangler.jsonc in your .gitignore file if it contains sensitive information.

1. Ensure your Cloudflare account is set up and you're authenticated with Wrangler.

2. Update your production environment variables:
   - Update the domain information in `packages/api/wrangler.jsonc` and `packages/web/wrangler.jsonc`
   - Set the correct values for `BETTER_AUTH_URL`, `BETTER_AUTH_COOKIES_DOMAIN`, etc.

3. Deploy your application:
   ```bash
   # Deploy both API and web concurrently
   bun deploy:all
   
   # Or deploy them individually
   bun deploy:api  # Deploys only the API
   bun deploy:web  # Deploys only the web frontend
   ```

4. After deployment, your application will be available at your configured domains:
   - API: https://api.your-domain.dev (or your custom domain)
   - Web: https://your-domain.dev (or your custom domain)

#### OpenNext for Cloudflare

This project uses [OpenNext](https://open-next.js.org/) to deploy Next.js applications to Cloudflare. OpenNext is an open-source adapter that enables Next.js applications to run on various serverless platforms, including Cloudflare Workers.

Special thanks to [Dax Raad](https://twitter.com/thdxr) and the [SST team](https://sst.dev) for creating and maintaining OpenNext, which makes it possible to deploy Next.js applications to Cloudflare's edge network with minimal configuration.

The integration is handled through the [`@opennextjs/cloudflare`](https://github.com/sst/open-next) package, which:
- Builds your Next.js application for Cloudflare Workers
- Handles asset management and routing
- Optimizes for Cloudflare's edge runtime environment

## 📁 Repository Structure

The @based-rose/stack is organized as a monorepo with a clear separation of concerns:

```

### Key Components

- **API Package**: Contains the Hono server with tRPC integration, database schema, and API routes. This is deployed to Cloudflare Workers.
  
- **Web Package**: Contains the Next.js frontend application with React components, pages, and styles. This is deployed to Cloudflare Pages via OpenNext.
  
- **Shared Package**: Contains code shared between the frontend and backend, such as types, constants, and utility functions. This ensures type safety across the entire application.

- **Scripts**: Utility scripts for setting up the database and environment variables.

### Type Safety Across Packages

One of the key benefits of this monorepo structure is the end-to-end type safety:

1. Database schema is defined in `packages/api/src/db/schema.ts`
2. This schema is used to generate TypeScript types
3. These types are shared via the shared package
4. The frontend can use these types for form validation and data display
5. tRPC ensures that API calls are type-safe from frontend to backend

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Wrangler Authentication Issues**
   ```
   Error: You need to login to Cloudflare first.
   ```
   Solution: Run `bun wrangler:login` and follow the authentication flow.

2. **Database Connection Errors**
   ```
   Error: D1_ERROR: database not found
   ```
   Solution: Ensure you've run `bun setup-db` and that the database ID in your wrangler.jsonc files matches.

3. **Environment Variable Issues**
   ```
   Error: Missing environment variable: BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
   ```
   Solution: Check that you've copied and updated all the necessary .env files as described in the Environment Configuration section.

4. **Port Conflicts**
   ```
   Error: Port 3000 is already in use
   ```
   Solution: Stop any other services using the port or change the port in your Next.js configuration.

5. **Deployment Failures**
   ```
   Error: Failed to deploy to Cloudflare
   ```
   Solution: Check your Cloudflare account permissions and ensure your wrangler.jsonc configuration is correct.

## 🧠 Opinionated Decisions

The @based-rose/stack makes several opinionated technical decisions to optimize for developer experience and deployment efficiency:

- **No Better Auth migrations → Full Drizzle schema**: We use Drizzle for all database schema management, including auth tables, for a unified approach to database management.
- **No Drizzle-kit push → Wrangler execute**: Direct database operations through Wrangler for better integration with Cloudflare's ecosystem.
- **Bun over npm/yarn/pnpm**: Significantly faster package management and runtime execution.
- **Biome over ESLint/Prettier**: Single tool for linting and formatting with better performance.
- **Monorepo structure**: Shared types and utilities across frontend and backend for maximum type safety.
- **Edge-first architecture**: Built for Cloudflare Workers from the ground up, not adapted afterward.
- **tRPC over REST/GraphQL**: End-to-end type safety without the need for code generation or schemas.
- **shadcn/ui over component libraries**: Unstyled, accessible components that you own and can customize.
- **D1 over other databases**: Native integration with Cloudflare Workers and zero configuration needed.
